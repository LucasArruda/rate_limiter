# Rate Limiter

Rate Limiter is a rails module that can easily limit requests per client for all endpoints or for specific ones.

To add it, all you have to do is `include RateLimit` in ApplicationController to have it on all your controllers using default settings of 100 request per hour (3600 seconds).

You can also add it directly to the controller you want to be rate limited.

To customize, just use helper methods `rate` and `period`, as following:

```
class AnImportantController < ApplicationController
  include RateLimit

  # those are the default (optional declaration)
  rate 100 # one hundred request
  period 3600 # one hour

  â€¦
end
```
